        <h4>What is Covid-19?</h4>
        <p class="Covid-19?"><tt>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by the virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first known case was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.[5] The disease quickly spread worldwide, resulting in the COVID-19 pandemic.
<br><br>
            The symptoms of COVID-19 are variable but often include fever,[6] cough, headache,[7] fatigue, breathing difficulties, loss of smell, and loss of taste.[8][9][10] Symptoms may begin one to fourteen days after exposure to the virus. At least a third of people who are infected do not develop noticeable symptoms.[11] Of those who develop symptoms noticeable enough to be classified as patients, most (81%) develop mild to moderate symptoms (up to mild pneumonia), while 14% develop severe symptoms (dyspnea, hypoxia, or more than 50% lung involvement on imaging), and 5% develop critical symptoms (respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan dysfunction).[12] Older people are at a higher risk of developing severe symptoms. Some people continue to experience a range of effects (long COVID) for years after infection, and damage to organs has been observed.[13] Multi-year studies are underway to further investigate the long-term effects of the disease.</tt>

        <h4>What is being used to stop covid-19?</h4>
        <p><tt>The NHS is currently offering COVID-19 vaccines to people at the highest risk of becoming unwell from COVID-19. The vaccines have been shown to reduce the likelihood of severe illness, but we do not know yet if they stop COVID-19 from spreading.</tt>
